        <h1>Bekal Fort</h1>
        <p>Bekal Fort, located in the Kasaragod district of Kerala, is one of the largest and best-preserved forts in the state. Here's a detailed description:</p>
        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Military Importance:</b> Bekal Fort served as an important military station for Tipu Sultan during his military expedition to capture Malabar.</li>
            <li><b>Control:</b> The fort later came under the control of the Mysore Sultanate, led by Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, before being captured by the British East India Company in the late 18th century.</li>
            <li><b>Construction:</b> Built by Shivappa Nayaka of the Keladi Nayaka dynasty in 1650 AD, Bekal Fort was designed to defend against invaders and protect the region's valuable spice trade.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Architectural Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Water Tank and Tunnels:</b> Within the fort, there is a large water tank with a flight of steps leading down to it. The fort also contains several underground tunnels, some of which were used as escape routes during sieges.</li>
            <li><b>Observation Tower:</b> The largest bastion houses a small observation tower, providing a commanding view of the Arabian Sea.</li>
            <li><b>Walls and Bastions:</b> The fort is surrounded by thick laterite stone walls that rise up to 12 meters high. Strategically placed bastions offer panoramic views of the sea and the surrounding landscape.</li>
